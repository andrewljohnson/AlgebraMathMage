# AlgebraMathMage 

This is an app for iPad to teach kids math, egged on by lots of little videos.

## Todo 
 * scorecard view
  * design view
  * show scorecard on completion
  * check for mastery before going to next set of 2 sections (and don't go on if they just switch to the last problem)
 * bug: selecting problem in menu before hitting continue leads to weird state
 * animation between scetion and chapter complete
 * don't show previous problem grayed out when doing random order questions
 
### Todo Later/Maybe
 * Bugs
   * limit usage to iPads in build

## Setup
Run the app in XCode.
